# #### Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.The training data set, (train.csv), has 785 columns. The first column, called "label", is the digit that was drawn by the user. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.

Reshape Images
Flatten 28*28 images to a 784 vector for each image
Train and test images (28px x 28px) .Dataframe as 1D vectors of 784 values. 
We reshape all data to 28x28x1 3D matrices.
Keras requires an extra dimension in the end which correspond to channels. 
MNIST images are gray scaled so it use only one channel. 
For RGB images, there is 3 channels, we would have reshaped 784px vectors to 28x28x3 3D matrices.

Encoding Label:
Output variable is an integer from 0 to 9. 
This is a multi-class classification problem. As such, it is good practice to use a one hot encoding of the 
class values, transforming the vector of class integers into a binary matrix.
We can easily do this using the built-in np_utils.to_categorical() helper function in Keras.

# 
# #### 
# BaseLine Model
# 
# Simple neural network with one hidden layer with the same number of neurons as there are inputs (784). 
# A rectifier activation function is used for the neurons in the hidden layer.A softmax activation function 
# is used on the output layer to turn the outputs into probability-like values and allow one class of the 10 to 
# be selected as the modelâ€™s output prediction. Logarithmic loss is used as the loss 
# function (called categorical_crossentropy in Keras) and the efficient ADAM gradient descent algorithm is 
# used to learn the weights.
