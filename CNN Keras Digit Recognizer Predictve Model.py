# #### Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.The training data set, (train.csv), has 785 columns. The first column, called "label", is the digit that was drawn by the user. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.

Encoding Label:
Output variable is an integer from 0 to 9. 
This is a multi-class classification problem. As such, it is good practice to use a one hot encoding of the 
class values, transforming the vector of class integers into a binary matrix.
We can easily do this using the built-in np_utils.to_categorical() helper function in Keras.

# ## Model Building
# 
# ### Keras Sequential API, is used for adding multiple layers starting from the input. Each convolution layer has filter for transforming the image. The first is the convolutional (Conv2D) layer. It is like a set of learnable filters. Each filter transforms a part of the image (defined by the kernel size) using the kernel filter. The kernel filter matrix is applied on the whole image. Filters can be seen as a transformation of the image. 
# 
# ### The second important layer in CNN is the pooling (MaxPool2D) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. Max pooling is added after the convolution layer ,after non-linearity function.
# 
# ## CNN Forward Pass e.g.: input->conv->ReLU->Pool->conv->ReLU->Pool->FC->softmax
# 
# ### Dropout is a regularization method, where a proportion of nodes in the layer are randomly ignored (setting their wieghts to zero) for each training sample. This drops randomly a propotion of the network and forces the network to learn features in a distributed way. This technique also improves generalization and reduces the overfitting. Used after convolution layer and pooling.
# 
# ### 'relu' is the rectifier (activation function max(0,x). The rectifier activation function is used to add non linearity to the network.
# 
# ### The Flatten layer is use to convert the final feature maps into a one single 1D vector. This flattening step is needed so that you can make use of fully connected layers after some convolutional/maxpool layers. It combines all the found local features of the previous convolutional layers.
# 
# ### Dense layer is used to output results

# In[ ]:


# Split the train and the validation set for the fitting
# Set the random seed
random_seed = 2
X_train, X_val, Y_train, Y_val = train_test_split(X_train, Y_train, test_size = 0.1, random_state=random_seed)


# ### BaseLine Model
# 
# #### 
# BaseLine Model
# 
# Simple neural network with one hidden layer with the same number of neurons as there are inputs (784). 
# A rectifier activation function is used for the neurons in the hidden layer.A softmax activation function 
# is used on the output layer to turn the outputs into probability-like values and allow one class of the 10 to 
# be selected as the modelâ€™s output prediction. Logarithmic loss is used as the loss 
# function (called categorical_crossentropy in Keras) and the efficient ADAM gradient descent algorithm is 
# used to learn the weights.
